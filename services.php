                            <p>
Many residential moving customers choose to store household items while making the transition into a new home. If you’re moving from house to house, but your new residence isn’t quite ready, or you need some additional storage space while you sell your previous home, United can help. Our specialized storage services provide an easy-to-use, flexible solution when you’re faced with long-distance moving schedule challenges.

Vault Storage: 
If you need storage apart from an interstate move, United’s long-distance moving agents also independently provide local moving and storage services through their own businesses and brands. For local long-term storage solutions, inquire about these companies’ vault storage options.</p>

Protecting you when unexpected loss or damage to your belongings occurs during your move is important to us; that is why we offer our basic Full Value Protection plan to every corporate relocation manager as part of our basic corporate relocation package.
Unless your employer has made other arrangements with Gulf, your moving quote will include our basic Full Value Protection option, which is plenty for most long-distance household moves. Under this option, should damage or loss occur during your Gulf move, your personal belongings will be repaired or replaced, or Gulf may offer you other compensation up to the total amount of the shipment protection that you select. Important terms and conditions apply, so be sure to ask your Gulf move coordinator for more details about the option selected by your company.</h6>
